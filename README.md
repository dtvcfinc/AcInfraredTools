# AcInfraredTools
Basic library to simplify the synchronization between raspberry and air conditioning units.

# Usage
### Export raw command. 
Creates a JSON with the pusles and gaps received:

`python ir_tools.py exportRawCommand --commandName 24_heat_fan_max`

### Print binary codes

Prints the codes received from the remote in binary format. Also compares the binary code received with the previous one and provides a visual representation of the differences(in red color the bits that changed and green the ones that didn't) between the codes, making it easier to determine which bits changed between each code:

`python ir_tools.py readBinaryCodes`

### Raw code comparator

Compares reference raw code with the codes received. This command is useful to compare the codes generated by the raspberry pi and adjust the timing so it matches the reference one. The blue color represents periods shorter than the reference one, red represents periods longer than the original one and in green valid periods with a tolarence of 100ms.

`python ir_tools.py rawCodeComparator 24_heat_fan_max`
